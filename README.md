# React Challenge #2
## Manipulating Component CSS

In this challenge you will learn how to dynamically change the styles of a page.

## The Challenge
There is a button on the page that is supposed to change the background color of the page to orange, specifically **#eb5202** color.

When the button is clicked it invokes the *changeBackgroundColor* function. Your job is write the logic inside that function that will change the background color of page to #eb5202.

You are NOT allowed to change the css stylesheet directly, or any of the class names.

All your work should be in the file **src/App.js**. Do NOT create or modify other files.

**Hint:** Use the component's **state**.

### Requirments
- Nodejs
- NPM

To start this challenge run the commands:
```
npm install

npm start
```

To test your code via the command line run the command:
```
npm test
```
If your code does not pass the tests, you *will not* be able to submit your code.


After you finish the challenge, commit and push your changes.

Have fun!
